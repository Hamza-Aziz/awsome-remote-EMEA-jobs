# Hiring from EMEA region

I know there is other awsome repos for remote jobs, but as a residant in the EMEA region , it was almost impossibe and time consuming to find a company there that hires from the EMEA region.


so this repo will list only the IT companies that hires from the EMEA region,and NOTHING else.
